catloaf chrome browser extension

If you have a lot of tabs open, they narrow to fit the window width and a page title can become unreadable. Catloaf takes care of this problem by announcing the title of the active tab in your browser.  Catloaf now features philisophical wisdom from "Zen and the Art of Loaf Posture Maintenance". There are no plans for a database but I will be putting in a catloaf calendar, which will change the catloaf image weekly. Images of loafing cats will be curated by a human. Contact me if you have a catloaf photo you would like considered for inclusion.
